# Governance

Governance controls various parameters for the ARTH protocol allowing the protocol to make changes that influence the behavior of the protocol. Governance execution is done via MAHA token holders.&#x20;

Governance can make the following changes

* **Set limits on how much collateral can be deposited in total for a particular cryptocurrency collateral:** This effectively allows ARTH to control its exposure to a particular kind of cryptocurrency. Or possibly even disable taking new loans for a cryptocurrency.
* **Set the borrowing & redemption rates:** Governance can decide on rates to encourage borrowing or redemption to influence the activity within the ecosystem
* **Add new collaterals:** Governance can decide to add in new collaterals for which a loan can be taken against.
