# Governance

Governance controls various parameters for the ARTH protocol which allows the protocol to make changes that influence its behavior. Governance execution is done with the help of  MAHA token holders.&#x20;

Governance can make the following changes

* **Set limits on how much collateral can be deposited in total for a particular cryptocurrency collateral:** This effectively allows ARTH to control its exposure to a particular kind of cryptocurrency. Or possibly even disable taking new loans for a cryptocurrency.
* **Set the borrowing & redemption rates:** Governance can decide on rates to encourage borrowing or redemption to influence the activity within the ecosystem
* **Add new collaterals:** Governance can decide whether or not to add new collaterals against which a loan can be taken.

Community members use the MAHA token to vote on key aspects of the ecosystem in order to collectively manage the parameters that keep ARTH stable and in check. Using democratic frameworks such as governance portals, forums & the power of social discourse, growth is driven by the community and for the community.
