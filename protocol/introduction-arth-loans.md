# Introducing Loans

ARTH in its true nature is a decentralized borrowing protocol that lets users draw interest-free loans against their crypto assets used as collateral.&#x20;

Loans are always lent in ARTH valuecoin (a stablecoin pegged to the Global Measurement Unit). Users need to commit a minimum Collateralization Ratio (CR) of 110%.&#x20;

The protocol also uses secondary measures to secure the loans. In surplus to the 110% collateral committed, there exists a Stability Pool of ARTH valuecoin. This pool acts as a means of last resort if the protocol needs to go in Recovery mode.

Learn more about the Stability Pool below.&#x20;

ARTH Loans is a fork of Liquity protocol with modifications that allow:

* To open loans with multiple cryptocurrency collaterals&#x20;
* Have governance govern the various parameters of the protocol.
* A dynamic price peg
* A lower minimum collateral ratio for stablecoin pools. (105% instead of 110%)
