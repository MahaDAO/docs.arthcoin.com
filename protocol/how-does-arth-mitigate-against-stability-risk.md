# Protocol Fees

Fees are charged by the protocol on various actions performed by users on the protocol. The ARTH platform charges three kinds of fees:

* Mint & Redemption Fees
* Stability Fees
* Liquidation Fees

### Mint & Redeem Fees

Redemption fees is a mechanism that is being used to encourage or discourage collateral redemption from within the protocol. Redemption fees are charged in MAHA tokens and are calculated as a percentage of the collateral that is being redeemed.

When Governance predicts that the protocol is under high risk of losing it's collateral, it sets the redemption fee at a higher percentage (from 5-20%). When Governance predicts that the protocol is under low risk, then the redemption fees is reduced to 1-5%.
