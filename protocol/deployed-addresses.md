# Deployed Addresses

## Core Protocol Deployment

These are the deployment addresses of the core smart contracts that represent the ARTH valuecoin. Source code for the various contracts can be found on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/MahaDAO/arth-core).

All ownership of the `ARTH` contracts is currently set to MahaDAO's governance contracts. To learn more about how governance operates, visit [docs.mahadao.com](https://docs.mahadao.com/)

## Cross Chain Deployments

This section details the various deployments of `ARTH` across various other chains. Holding `ARTH` across various chains poses the risk of the bridged version of `ARTH` becoming unbacked if the bridge gets attacked.

For best security, we recommend using `ARTH` on the Ethereum chain. For low transaction fees, we recommend using `ARTH` on various other chains (such as Polygon or BSC).

Bridged version of `ARTH` are made accessible using [AnySwap](https://anyswap.exchange/)
