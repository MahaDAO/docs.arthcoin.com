**If I buy ARTHB. Then later ARTH goes above 1.05 and hence in the expansion phase. I have two options- one is to redeem my bond, second is not to. If I hold my ARTHB, will I be getting the share out of the 90% of the newly minted ARTH? By keeping ARTH?**  
Yes, it’s not a reward but rather paying back the ARTHB holders; ARTHB goes in and ARTH comes out. When ARTH price officially gets over its target price in the following epoch, new ARTH is minted as the system is now in expansion. Out of all the ARTH minted, 90% is used for paying back ARTHB holders who want to redeem their Bonds. The remainder 10% is then distributed as Seigniorage if we are in expansion mode. More about Seigniorage distribution can be found [here](https://docs.arthcoin.com/arth-201/expansion-mechanics/seiongrage-distribution).

**When I redeem my ARTHB after ARTH is more than $1, do I receive back DAI or ARTH?**

**Can ARTHB be redeemed only at the price target of $1, not at $1.01 or above? If it can be redeemed at a higher rate, do I get the current redeemed price or $1?**  
ARTHB can be redeemed at any price above its target price based on the 12hr & 1hr TWAP. However, ARTHB is always redeemed at a 1:1 ratio with ARTH.

**At the moment the ARTH target price is $1, when will the target price be calculated using the GMU?**

**What is the max supply of ARTH?**  
Because ARTH is an algo stablecoin, there is no max supply for ARTH. It is based on how much demand there is for ARTH, more demands means supply will increase per Epoch.

**If I add more liquidity to my currently existing liquidity, does the lockup for the entire LP reset itself to another day?**
