MahaDAO launched the official $ARTH protocol on 22 January 2021 that converts the ARTH token into the world's first valuecoin comprising \(ARTH Bonds, Arth Global Measurement Unit \(GMU\), Seignorage shares, etc\) the innovative mechanism of the most advanced decentralised protocol. ARTH is [NOT a rebase coin](appendix-typesofstablecoins/seigniorage-shares.md). ARTH is based on the model of seigniorage share model. $ARTH has an elastic supply that has the potential to transition into a hybrid model that incorporates a partially collateral-backed mechanism.
