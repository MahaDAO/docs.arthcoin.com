  This page talks about what is ARTH and what makes it different from other
  stablecoins.

# Overview

ARTH is a stablecoin that is designed to overtime appreciate against the US dollar whilst at the same time remain relatively stable.

ARTH is issued using decentralized smart contracts that use cryptocurrency as collateral to maintain its peg. The fees charged to mint ARTH using cryptocurrency collateral at 0% interest rates which makes it very cost effective for borrowing/lending.

### 0% Interest Fees on Borrowing

You take out loans. That’s it. No interests accrued, at all. Unlike lending protocols like Compound or MakerDAO, the way ARTH does this is by charging a one-time borrowing fee that adjust algorithmically and is taken when a loan is opened.

### **Minimal Collateralization Ratio**

110% — that’s it! And In some cases when the collateral used is stablecoins, the ratio is even lower, all the way down to 105%.

Although we advise users to put a CR of not below 150%, the system allows for collateralization up to 110%. That means you can only be liquidated once your CR reaches below 110%.

### Taking leverage long positions on yield farms/cryptocurrencies

Amongst the various types of assets that are accepted as collateral to mint ARTH, borrowers can deposit yield farm tokens and leverage their yields.

Since ARTH is a stablecoin with trading pairs across various other cryptocurrencies, you can also effectively gain a leveraged exposure to cryptocurrencies that can be used as collateral to mint ARTH.

### **Staking Rewards**

You can find a list of all staking/farming programs on [https://app.arthcoin.com/#/farming](https://polygon.arthcoin.com/#/farming). More LP/Staking Pools with partner projects will be announced at launch.

### No depreciation or loss of purchasing power

One of the biggest differentiators of ARTH amongst other stablecoins is that it is inherently designed to appreciate against the US dollar.

This means users who hold ARTH for longer periods of time should see their purchasing power increase when compared to fiat currencies.
