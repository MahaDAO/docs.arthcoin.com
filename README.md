# Overview

ARTH is a stablecoin that is designed to overtime appreciate against the US dollar whilst at the same time remain relatively stable.

ARTH is issued using decentralized smart contracts that use cryptocurrency as collateral to maintain its peg. The fees charged to mint ARTH using cryptocurrency collateral is 0% which makes it very cost effective for borrowing/lending.
