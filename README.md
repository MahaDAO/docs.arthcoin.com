## Why use ARTH?

### Taking leverage long positions on yield farms

Amongst the various types of assets that are accepted as collateral to mint ARTH, borrowers can deposit yield farm tokens and leverage their yields.&#x20;

### Taking leverage long positions on cryptocurrencies

Since ARTH is a stablecoin with trading pairs across various other cryptocurrencies, you can effectively gain a leveraged exposure to cryptocurrencies that can be used as collateral to mint ARTH.

### No depreciation or loss of purchasing power

One of the biggest differentiators of ARTH amongst other stablecoins is that it is inherently designed to appreciate against the US dollar.

This means users who hold ARTH for longer periods of time should see their purchasing power increase when compared to fiat currencies.
