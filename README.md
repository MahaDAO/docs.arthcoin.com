  stablecoins.

# Overview

`ARTH` is a stablecoin that is designed to appreciate over time against the US dollar while at the same time, it remains relatively stable.

`ARTH` is minted/burnt using decentralized smart contracts that use `ETH` as collateral to maintain its peg. The interest rate charged to mint `ARTH` using `ETH` is 0%, which makes it very cost-effective for borrowing/lending.

`ARTH` is fully collateralized with mechanisms that give it a backing of at least 110% in `ETH`.

### 0% Interest Fees on Borrowing

You take out a loan with `ETH`, and that’s it. No interests accrued at all.&#x20;

Unlike other lending protocols like Compound or MakerDAO, there are no interest fees that the borrower has to pay when borrowing `ARTH` with `ETH`.&#x20;

The way `ARTH` does this is by charging a one-time borrowing fee that adjusts algorithmically whenever a loan is opened. This makes ARTH the cheapest stablecoin to borrow against with `ETH`.

### **Minimal Collateralization Ratio**

110% — that’s it!

Although we advise users to put a CR above 200%, the system allows users to borrow with a collateral ratio of up to 110%. That means you can only be liquidated if your CR reaches below 110%.

### **Earn Passive Yield (Staking)**

As the stablecoin begins to grow, you will find many new opportunities to earn a passive yield from the protocol. You can find a list of all farming programs on [https://arth.mahadao.com/#/farming](https://arth.mahadao.com/#/farming)

### No Depreciation or Loss of Purchasing Power

One of the biggest differentiators of `ARTH` amongst other stablecoins is that it is designed to appreciate against the US dollar.&#x20;

This means users who hold `ARTH` for longer periods of time should see an increase in their purchasing power when compared to other currencies.
