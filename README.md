# Welcome to ARTH

## What is ARTH?

ARTH is a currency that is designed not to be pegged to government-owned currencies \(like US Dollar, Euro, or Chinese Yuan\), but also remains relatively stable \(unlike Gold and Bitcoin\).

By not being influenced by government-owned currencies, ARTH in effect becomes immune to inflation. And by also being stable, ARTH in effect also becomes an ideal choice of currency for means of trade, unlike Gold/Bitcoin which is used more as a store of value rather than a medium of exchange.
