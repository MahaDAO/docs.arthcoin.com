# Welcome to ARTH

## What is ARTH?

ARTH is a new type of currency designed to not be pegged to government-owned currencies \(like US Dollar, Euro, or Chinese Yuan\), but still remain relatively stable \(unlike Gold and Bitcoin\).

Without being influenced by government-owned currencies, ARTH will be immune to inflation. Through stability, ARTH also becomes a superior choice of currency for means of trade. This is unlike Gold or Bitcoin, which are used more as a store of value rather than a medium of exchange.
