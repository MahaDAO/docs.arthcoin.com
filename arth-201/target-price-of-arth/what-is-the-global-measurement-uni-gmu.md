# Global Measurement Unit \(GMU\)

## What is the Global Measurement Unit \(GMU\)?

ARTH uses a special method of measuring an asset’s buying power called the Global Measurement Unit \(GMU\) which represents a basket of assets carefully selected with adequate weights to present strong hedge strategy against economic turbulence and risks such as inflation and currency risk.

As a result, the target price of ARTH is not going to be fixed to 1 US Dollar, but rather, the combined value of the assets which form part of the basket.

The basket consists of several assets, some of which are traditional, well known financial assets and others are new age, digital financial assets. Precisely speaking, the GMU consists of the following assets and their respective weights:

* **80% — Collection of Fiat currencies** \(this includes USD, GBP, INR, JPY, CNY, CHF, CAD\)
* **15% — Gold \(**often considered a safe-haven asset
* **5% — Bitcoin \(**also started to show properties of being a safe have asset as of recently\)

Based on prior research we believe that these 3 assets, when combined in the right way, can provide a safe and sound base for preventing ARTH from depreciating in value.

## How were the weightings of the GMU calculated?

A methodological process was followed in order to determine the weightings of each portion of the GMU, specifically, extensive analysis was conducted across globally available metrics and data from prominent financial institutions such as the IMF in order to determine the average percentage makeup of these assets across both economies and portfolios globally.

### **A. Calculating the Currency weighting**

The countries and their currencies were analyzed on the basis of their average share of world real GDP \(measured in constant 2010 US$\) between the years 2011 and 2019, with a minimum requirement of at least 2% of a share in world GDP.

Currencies included in basket come from countries which accounted for more than 70% of world Base GDP. At this moment countries which fulfil mentioned conditions were as per the following table:

In addition to these well-known IMF basket of currencies, we also chose currencies such as the Swiss franc, Indian rupee, Brazilian real, and Canadian dollar so that the basket can act as a better diversifier.

The Swiss franc is the only currency from the basket whose country doesn’t meet the requirement of 2% in World GDP share however we made an exception due to the fact that the Swiss franc and Japanese yen are generally looked upon from investors' point of view as a safe heaven. These 2 currencies have proven to be investors' favourite choice during crises.

**B. Calculating the Gold weighting**

Throughout history, gold has been proven to be the most trusted asset in difficult times hence gold has found itself a place in the global measurement unit.

The decision to include gold was not based merely on the presumption that gold has been viewed upon as a store of value but on the fact that central banks still hold gold as foreign exchange reserves.

Keeping significant amounts of gold in foreign exchange reserves is a part of a more conservative Central bank’s strategy, regarding gold’s hedge capability, against risky assets, gold is considered as a safe haven.

After analyzing major central banks' foreign exchange reserves, the conclusion was that gold should be weighted with a weight of not less than 15%.

When specific events occur, such as a surge in the price of BTC, the weighting of gold should increase, and the weighting of BTC should decrease, and vice versa, in order to prevent drastic volatility of the GMU's value.

**C. Calculating the BTC weighting**

Bitcoin has been chosen because it's price reflects spillovers from all other financial and commodity markets.

Research has shown that Bitcoin and Gold provide a strong hedge against inflation. Based on research, followed by a conservative portfolio diversification strategy which suggests a ratio of risk-free v/s risky \(ratio of gold and bitcoin\) asset to be 3:1, Bitcoin should be weighted with a weight of 5%.

**Final GMU calculation**

GMU = 0.8\*\(Basket of currencies\) + 0.15\*GOLD+ 0.05\*BTC

The basket of currencies, gold and BTC were weighted by weights, respectively, 0.8, 0.15 and 0.05. Which means that 80% of the value of the basket of currencies was taken into account, 15% of gold’s value and 5% of BTC’s value, all denominated in US$.

The following chart outlines the historical performance of the GMU against USD over time:

## How is the price of ARTH calculated?

Whilst we talk about ARTH in terms of it’s buying power, to the end user, ARTH will most likely be represented in their native fiat currency \(like USD, RNB, EUR etc..\).

The value of ARTH in a particular currency can simply be thought of as the net value of all the underlying collaterals backing 1 ARTH token denominated in that currency.

This would mean that if we were to calculate the USD value of one ARTH token, then it’d look something like the following. \(note that BTCUSD price at the time of writing is 10,500$\)

_\(assuming three collaterals used: ie USD, Gold and BTC\)_

USD value = \(supply of locked USD\) x \(USD/USD price ~ 1$\)

Gold value = \(supply of gold USD\) x \(XAU/USD price\)

BTC value = \(supply of locked BTC\) x \(BTC/USD price\)

ARTH circulation = total circulation of ARTH

ARTH USD = \(USD value + Gold value + BTC value\) / \(ARTH circulation\)

But this does not account for slippage or the various transaction fees that a user will have to account for when moving collaterals back and forth the various sidechains for example.
