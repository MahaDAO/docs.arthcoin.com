# Target Price of ARTH

Most elastic stablecoin provide nothing more than just a USD stablecoin that competes with the utility of existing stablecoins like USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.

ARTH on the other hand has a target price that is dynamic and is based on an index \(called as the GMU\) that comprises of the following assets in its basket.

* 80% Fiat
* 15% Gold
* 5% Bitcoin

The price of ARTH shall start off from US$1. As the asset fluctuates, the index fluctuates as well. This means there will be periods with the ARTHâ€™s cycle where the protocol will be in an [expansion/contraction](../expansion-mechanics/) phase depending on the volatility on the target price as well.

This level of dynamism not only brings extra utility to the ARTH coin \(as it is a different kind of stablecoin, not pegged to the dollar\) but it also creates situations where the protocol can automatically fall into an expansion cycle if the target price suddenly starts to follow a downward trend.
