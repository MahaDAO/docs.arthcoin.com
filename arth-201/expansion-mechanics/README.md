# Stabilizing Mechanism in ARTH

Because stablecoins are almost always pegged to a target price, it is ideal for them to revolve around that price. Most stablecoins are pegged to the $1 price or another fiat currency\(like Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, etc\). 

ARTH, however, is price pegged to the Global Measurement Unit\(GMU\). You can read more about ARTH's target price [here](../target-price-of-arth/). For simplicity purposes, ARTH's initial target price is set at $1. Although, please note that this target price is subject to constant change because of ARTH valuecoin's peculiar peg to GMU instead of a fiat currency.   
  
As the pegged price is used as an anchor, if the current value of the token falls on either side of the target price, the elastic coin usually goes into one of the two phases, viz. Expansion or Contraction, depending on which side the coin is. 

## **Expansion Phase in ARTH** 

When the 12hr TWAP price of ARTH is **above** $1.05 & all ARTH Bond debt is cleared, the system mints more ARTH tokens & distributes it amongst all token holders who have **bonded their tokens on arthcoin.com**, thereby increasing the circulating supply in the market. This distribution is also known as [seigniorage distribution](https://docs.arthcoin.com/arth-201/expansion-mechanics/seiongrage-distribution). Because the token supply is expanded during this phase, it is known as an **Expansion Phase.**   
  
This creates an increased supply & a decreased demand in the market. Hence, getting the token price back to its target price. 

To know more about how the distribution is shared, please check the Seigniorage Distribution tab [here](https://docs.arthcoin.com/arth-201/expansion-mechanics/seiongrage-distribution).  

## Contraction Phase in ARTH 

When the 12hr TWAP price of ARTH is **below** $0.95 & the 1hr TWAP price is below $0.95, **users can purchase ARTHB\(ARTH Bonds\)**, which can later be redeemed for higher rewards. This phase is often known as the **Contraction Phase** in other algo stablecoin systems**.** 

More on ARTH Bonds in the next section.   
  
It is common knowledge today that many elastic stablecoins are facing problems of having very long expansion & debt cycles. The ARTH model of a seigniorage share aims to exactly defeat this drawback by issuing ARTH Bonds. More on ARTH Bonds in the[ next section](arth-bonds.md).
