# Bonding/Staking ARTH

When the system is in expansion mode\( 12hr TWAP price of ARTH is **above** $1.05\), users can bond/stake their assets to earn inflationary rewards or seigniorage shares. Bonding refers to the action of locking in tokens in the ARTH protocol so as to receive inflationary rewards when the protocol expands the ARTH supply.

When a user bonds his tokens, they are locked in for a certain period of time and can be redeemed only after the lock-in expires.   
  
Rewards are distributed at every epoch, when the 12-hr TWAP is above $1.05 & all previous Bond debt is cleared.
