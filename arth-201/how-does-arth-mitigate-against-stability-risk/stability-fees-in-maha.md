# Stability fees in MAHA

For every ARTH Bond redemption, the ARTHB holder will have to pay a fee which is a percentage of the value being liquidated in MAHA tokens.

This acts as a method to dampen the redemption of bonds which can often create a negative price impact if done all too quickly. The stability fee is not meant to de-incentivize bondholders from redeeming their bonds but rather used to control the speed at which they do so.

The stability fee should ideally be a significantly small amount so that the bondholders still gain a net positive return when they redeem their bonds.
