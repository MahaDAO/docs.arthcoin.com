# Ensuring Stability

Whilst elastic stable-coins are new in the space, they have drawn criticism for being too volatile.

Most elastic stablecoin protocols are almost always in the contraction phase which is risky because it forces the protocol to issue more debt. The moment the price goes above the peg, whales sell bringing the price back to below the peg.

> Most elastic stablecoin protocols are more often than not, always in the contraction phase.

Secondly \(and while this is not as severe\) the expansion cycles of most coins are driven mostly by yield farmers and speculators.

Such kind of demand is good for initial volume in the early days of the protocol but does not cater well in the long-term. Demand for the utility of the asset is needed to provide healthy long-term growth for the protocol.

## How ARTH addresses these problems

Based on these points, the MahaDAO team have come up with a few key innovations that make the ARTH valuecoin different from other stablecoins, these being;

* **Dynamic target price** - based on the GMU basket
* **Uniswap Integration** - Tying bond purchases to the Uniswap price
* **Stability Fees** - A measure to dampen bond redemptions
