# Rebase Mechanism

**A Rebase is a last resort mechanism** where the circulating supply of a token is adjusted so that it forces the current market price to meet the target price and collateralization ratio. 

Please note that the ARTH rebase will happen only once at the time of ARTH 2.0 Launch. Below is an example of how rebase works: 

If the collateralization ratio of ARTH is 100% and the platform is undercollateralized by 50%, a 50% rebase will happen.  

To elaborate, if Alice has 1 ARTH, to match the 100% CR, a rebase mechanism will be triggered once and Alice will be left with 0.5 ARTH \(to match the CR\). 

## When are rebases triggered?

ARTH triggers a rebase when the value of the collateral locked cannot sustain the protocol's collateralization ratio. Such an event could occur during the following scenarios:

1. During the ARTH Genesis Launch
2. A Black-Friday event

Rebases are triggered by Governance. 

_**The use of Rebase should be thought of only as a mechanism of last resort.**_
