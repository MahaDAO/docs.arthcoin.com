# Charging Fees

Fees are charged by the protocol when actions that users take have a net negative effect on the protocol.  This is done to not just encourage users to perform the right kind of activities but also generate revenue for all staking pools and for ARTHX holders.

The ARTH platform charges two kinds of fees:

* Redemption Fees
* Trading Fees

All fees generated by the platform are redirected as revenue for ARTHX holders and distributed via the ARTHX staking pools.
