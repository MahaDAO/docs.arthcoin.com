# Minting and Burning ARTH

ARTH has special mechanisms that allow it to be a highly scalable stablecoin. In this section, we explain the different scenarios where ARTH will be minted and burnt.

## When ARTH is minted?

ARTH is only minted whenever collateral is deposited into any one of the protocol pools. This ensures that every ARTH that is minted will always have some kind of backing to ensure its stability.

ARTH is never minted freely without some kind of collateral being deposited into the protocol.

## When ARTH is burnt?

ARTH is burnt when it is redeemed for its underlying collateral. Since there are multiple pools, users can go to any one of the collateral pools 

## Special Case: Protocol Becomes Over Collateralized

Because ARTH is burnt more freely than it is minted, there could be a possibility where the protocol could become over collateralized due to the excessive burning of ARTH

That is, the protocol could possibly have more collateral than what is the current market cap of ARTH.
