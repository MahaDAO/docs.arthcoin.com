# ARTH vs Other Stablecoins

Elastic stable coins are special coins that derive their stability simply as a function of market demand. The more the demand there is for the coin, the protocol mints more coins to meet it. if the demand drops, the protocol issues debt to burn a portion of the supply.

In this section, we describe the economic driving factors that have been designed into the ARTH stablecoin platform to ensure the stability and success of the project.

In the subsequent articles, you will find a suite of innovative measures/features that make the ARTH platform unique& different from other stablecoins.

## How is ARTH different from other algorithmic stablecoins?

ARTH combines the best features of each stablecoin as illustrated in the following table, namely;

* Decentralization via Governance over protocol decisions
* Basket-backed collateral
* Elastic or algorithmic supply
* Pragmatic epoch durations
* Reasonable caps on debt and supply increases
