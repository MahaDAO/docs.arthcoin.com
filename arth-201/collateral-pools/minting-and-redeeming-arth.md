# Minting and Redeeming ARTH

The collateral pools are the primary way how new ARTH tokens are entered into the market. Minting and Redeeming are the functions used by the protocol to mint/burn new ARTH tokens. 

## Minting ARTH

ARTH is minted when a user deposits a ratio of collateral and ARTHX tokens into the pool. The ratio at which the assets are provided is decided by the [collateralization ratio](collateralization-ratio.md).

## **Redeeming ARTH**
