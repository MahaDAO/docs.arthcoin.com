# Collateralization Ratio

## What is the Collateralization Ratio \(CR\)?

## How does a change in CR affect the protocol?

## Bootstrapping the CR

At the launch of ARTH 2.0, the collateralization ratio will be set differently for redemption and for minting.

During the bootstrapping period, the redemption collateralization ratio will be set at 0% and the minting collateralization ratio will be set at 100%.

This means that during the bootstrapping phase, users that redeem their ARTH for the underlying collateral will get 0% collateral and 100% ARTHX for every ARTH they redeem.

Likewise, for users who would like to mint ARTH, they'll deposit 100% collateral and 0% ARTHX to mint ARTH proportionate to their collateral's worth.

This has the strong net effect of bootstrapping the collateralization ratio from 0% to a stable collateralization ratio.

After the bootstrapping phase has been completed, the new collateralization ratio will be calculated based on how much collateral is locked and how ARTH is in circulation.
