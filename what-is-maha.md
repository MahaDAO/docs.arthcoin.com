# MAHA and Governance

{% hint style="info" %}
In-depth documentation about the MAHA Governance can be found here: [https://docs.mahadao.com/governance/overview](https://docs.mahadao.com/governance/overview)
{% endhint %}

`MAHA` is the governance and utility token that regulates the `ARTH` flatcoin and keeps the protocol decentralized. Decentralization is one of the most important features that gives value to the `ARTH` token. The more decentralized `ARTH` becomes, the easier it becomes for users to trust the functionalities governing `ARTH`.

Community members use the `MAHA` token to vote on key aspects of the ecosystem in order to collectively manage the parameters that keep `ARTH` stable and in check. Using democratic frameworks such as governance portals, forums & the power of social discourse, growth is driven by the community and for the community.

Governance can make the following changes

* **Update the price oracles:** If ever there is a need to change the target price mechanism for `ARTH`, governance can decide to vote on a new price oracle for the protocol.
* **Set the stability fees:** The stability fees further influence how much `MAHA` is burnt off for redemption.
* **Set the borrowing & redemption rates:** Governance can decide on rates to encourage borrowing or redemption to influence the activity within the ecosystem
* **Add new minters for ARTH**: Governance can get the powers to whitelist addresses or contracts that can mint/burn ARTH. (Relevant for any smart contract upgrades that need to be performed for ARTH).

### Why Do We Need Governance?

The need for governance comes simply to ensure that the protocol not only stays protected in the dire event of a black swan but also remains relevant when market situations change.

Since it's difficult to predict what design decisions for `ARTH` will remain relevant for the years to come, some kind of governance is needed to make sure that `ARTH` not only stays relevant but also stays ahead of its time.

At the same time, governance is designed in such a way that it remains as decentralized as possible and shouldn't somehow centralize power to destabilize `ARTH`.
