# MAHA and Governance

MAHA is the governance and utility token that regulates the ARTH value coin and keeps the protocol decentralized. Decentralization is one of the most important features that gives value to the ARTH token. The more decentralized ARTH becomes, the easier it becomes for users to trust the functionalities governing ARTH.

Community members use the MAHA token to vote on key aspects of the ecosystem in order to collectively manage the parameters that keep ARTH stable and in check. Using democratic frameworks such as governance portals, forums & the power of social discourse, growth is driven by the community and for the community.

Governance can make the following changes

* **Update the price oracles:** If ever these was a need to change the target price mechanism for ARTH, governance can decide to vote on a new price oracle for the protocol.
* **Set the stability fees:** The stability fees further influence how much MAHA is burnt off for a redemption.
* **Set the borrowing & redemption rates:** Governance can decide on rates to encourage borrowing or redemption to influence the activity within the ecosystem

### Why do we need Governance?

The need for governance comes simply to ensure that the protocol not only stays protected in the dire event of a black swan, but it also remains relevant when situations change in the market.

Every few years market situations change. It's difficult to predict what design decisions for ARTH will remain relevant for the years to come.

Which is why some kind of governance is needed to make sure that ARTH will stay ahead of it's time.

At the same time governance is designed in such a way that it shouldn't somehow centralized power to destabilize ARTH.
