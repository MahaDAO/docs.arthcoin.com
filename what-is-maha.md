# MAHA and Governance

MAHA is the governance and utility token that regulates the ARTH valuecoin and keeps the protocol decentralized. Decentralization is one of the most important features that gives value to the ARTH token. The more decentralized ARTH becomes, the easier it becomes for users to trust the functionalities governing ARTH.

MAHA token holders have an influence on ARTH in a number of different scenarios. MAHA token holders can govern:

* Stability fees
* Protocol direction & strategy
* Improvement proposals that optimise the Protocol

Community members use the MAHA token to vote on key aspects of the ecosystem in order to collectively manage the parameters that keep ARTH stable and in check. Using democratic frameworks such as governance portals, forums & the power of social discourse, growth is driven by the community and for the community.

Governance can make the following changes

* **Set limits on how much collateral can be deposited in total for a particular cryptocurrency collateral:** This effectively allows ARTH to control its exposure to a particular kind of cryptocurrency. Or possibly even disable taking new loans for a cryptocurrency.
* **Set the borrowing & redemption rates:** Governance can decide on rates to encourage borrowing or redemption to influence the activity within the ecosystem
* **Add new collaterals:** Governance can decide whether or not to add new collaterals against which a loan can be taken.
