# ARTH v1 - Genesis Launch

At the start of the protocol, the initial distribution of $ARTH is given out proportionately and evenly to those who stake into the various smart contracts.

There was no team pre-mine and it was a completely community-focused distribution that took place between **16th January 2021-21st January 2021.** 

The first 500,000 ARTH genesis tokens \(worth 500,000 at the start with a $1 starting price\) were distributed to the following community pools:

To keep the distribution fair and simple; all pools except the MahaDAO pools were given the same number of tokens across a period of 5 days. The MahaDAO pool receives a 20% bonus allocation as compared to other pools.
