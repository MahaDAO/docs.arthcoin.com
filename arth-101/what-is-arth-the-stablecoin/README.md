# What is ARTH?

ARTH is a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin that combines the best features of basket-pegged stablecoins and elastic stablecoins to create the world's first "value-stable" cryptocurrency.

It is designed to maintain its purchasing power over time, irrespective of which direction the market moves. The core pillars which drive the value stability of the ARTH coin are:

* Global Measurement Unit \(GMU\) - the algorithm which maintains the basket of assets
* ARTH Bond - elastic stablecoin seigniorage shares governing the minting and burning of new ARTH tokens

## How does ARTH solve the problem of declines in purchasing power?

The ARTH ecosystem builds upon MakerDAO’s concept of DAI to pioneer new mechanisms, resulting in a coin that’s both value-stable and a raw measure of an asset’s buying power. 

ARTH is able to do this as it is pegged to stable assets which are complete hedges of one other, so that if one asset depreciates in buying power, the other appreciates. Thus, keeping the net buying power of the resulting coin stable.
