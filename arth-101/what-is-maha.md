MAHA, as the name signifies, refers to a supreme, magnanimous, greater than itself characteristic, which the MAHA governance token embodies.

Community members use the MAHA token to vote on key aspects of the ecosystem in order to collectively manage the parameters that keep ARTH stable and in check. Using democratic frameworks such as governance portals, forums & the power of social discourse, growth is driven by the community and for the community.
