# What is ARTHX?

ARTH Shares is the solution in bringing stability to ARTH but also keeping ARTH partially collateralized. ARTH Shares \(ARTHX\) is a volatile token that is designed to absorb the volatility of ARTH.

When ARTH is trading above 1$, arbitrageurs will buy ARTHX to mint ARTH and sell the ARTH in the open market to realize a profit. Hence bringing the price of ARTH down to the 1$ mark.

When ARTH is trading below 1$, arbitrageurs will purchase ARTH from the open market and then redeem/burn the ARTH to get back the underlying collateral along with some ARTHX which is sold off in the market to realize a profit. Hence reducing the supply of ARTH to meet the actual demand for it.

However, there are many things that make ARTHX a more attractive token as well. ARTHX is a deflationary token and there will be no more than 10,000 ARTHX tokens in circulation. 

If the protocol realizes that it has excess collateral then itâ€™ll trigger a buyback of ARTHX using the actual collateral, burning the ARTHX out of the supply.

## Advantages of holding ARTHX

ARTHX has the chance of appreciating and being bought back by the protocol in a bull market. In a bull market, the value of the collateral exceeds the collateralization ratio of ARTH, and so the protocol ends up with excess collateral which it needs to sell off in the market. To do so, the protocol performs a ["buy back and burn"]() with ARTHX using some of the excess collateral. This creates upward price pressure on ARTHX.

Further ARTHX holders earn to different kinds of [platform fees](../arth-201/how-does-arth-mitigate-against-stability-risk.md) that get charged when users interact with the protocol. These fees get distributed to ARTHX stakers. ARTHX holders earn fees in collateral tokens and in MAHA/ARTH.

## Risks of ARTHX

While there are many potential benefits in holding ARTHX, there are also risks that come along with the benefits. The risks have been outlined below.

* ARTHX can witness sell pressure when the market turns into a bear market: When the market turns into a bear market and the net value of the underlying collateral decreases, then the protocol sells of collateral in return for a discount in ARTHX. This ARTHX is sold by arbitrageurs to keep ARTH stable and realize a profit. 
* ARTHX is a relatively new concept and can have undiscovered economic flaws: Being a new concept has its pros and cons. ARTHX comes in that same boat.
