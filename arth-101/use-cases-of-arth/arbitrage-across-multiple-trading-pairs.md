# Performing Arbitrage Across Multiple Volatile Currencies

~~As the ARTH valuecoin is pegged to the Global Measurement Unit & not the US Dollar, this is one of the differentiating features of ARTH, making it peculiar not only amongst elastic stablecoins like ESD, BAC, FRAX but also amongst collateral-backed stablecoins like DAI or USDT/USDC.~~

By having trading pairs that offer assets, ARTH in effect also plays the role of becoming an arbitrage token. Allowing traders to trade against the market inefficiencies with ARTH.
