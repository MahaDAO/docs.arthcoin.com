# Elastic Stablecoins - Basics

## What are stablecoins?

Stablecoins are a class of cryptocurrency whose aim is to maintain a "peg" \(same price\) as the value of the reserve assets that are being used to back their issuance.

The primary use of stablecoins historically has been as a hedge to the volatility that is normally associated with the use of cryptocurrencies, this could be in the form of:

* Limiting losses when trading cryptocurrencies or 
* Enabling fast, value-stable payments to counterparties such as employees, contractors, investors etc

An alternate way of looking at stablecoins is that they are aimed at replicating the three "properties" of sound money on the Blockchain, namely:

* Medium of exchange - a universally accepted form of payment for goods and services
* Unit of account - a standard unit of measure for the market value of said goods and services
* Store of value - a stable store of value where purchasing power is preserved over time

## Types of Stablecoins

Stablecoins can be classified as: 

* Fiat-backed \(e.g. USD, EUR, CNY\)
* Asset-backed \(e.g. Gold\)
* Basket-backed \(a combination of the above\)
* Crypto-backed \(e.g. ETH\)
* Algorithmic or Elastic stablecoins \(e.g. AMPL\)
* Seigniorage Shares \(e.g. ESD\)

Alternatively, they can also be classified as: 

* Centralized & Unregulated - USDT
*  Centralized but Regulated - USDC
* Decentralized & Overcollateralized - DAI
*  Decentralized but Uncollateralized - RSR, AMPLE, ESD

ARTH valuecoin is a combination of both basket-pegged stablecoins and seigniorage shares stablecoins, which makes it a partially collateralized stablecoin. ARTH aims to optimize its stability mechanism by taking the best of both the collateral backed system & elastic supply system, thereby uncovering a world of possibilities that beckon the stablecoin space.
