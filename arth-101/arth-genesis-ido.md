# ARTH IDO

The ARTH Genesis IDO will bootstrap the protocol with a target of 100,000 ETH in exchange for a discount in ARTH. 

The IDO will follow a bonding curve sale to bootstrap the protocol. Users who contribute ETH at the beginning of the protocol will receive a bigger discount for ARTH. The curve is described by the following formula.

$$
Price_{reward} = Price_{starting} + \dfrac{a^x - 1}{a} * b
$$
