# Rewards & Fees

The system charges fees in 3 ways:

* **Borrowing fee:** Borrowing fee is charged in ARTH. As the name suggests, it is charged once when the borrower draws a new loan position by committing 110% collateral. The borrowing fee is variable in nature, that is it increases if ARTH is trading below its peg, to demotivate more ARTH to be minted.
* **Redemption fee:** Redemption fee is charged in the collateral used to borrow. As the name suggests, it is charged once when the borrower redeems his loan position for collateral. The redemption fee is variable in nature, that is the fees increase if the number of redemptions are high.
* **Stability fee:** X% Stability fee is charged at redemption like the redemption fee. This fee is accumulated and 50% of it goes to the frontend provider and 50% to ecosystem funds, which is then used to pay the ARTH/ARTHX Debt Pool holders.
