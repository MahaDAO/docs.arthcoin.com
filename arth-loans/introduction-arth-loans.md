# Introduction: ARTH Loans

ARTH Loans is an algorithmic borrowing protocol that lets users draw [interest-free](https://app.gitbook.com/@liquity/s/liquity-docs/faq/borrowing#how-can-you-offer-borrowing-at-a-0-interest-rate) loans against their crypto assets used as collateral. Loans are always lent in ARTH valuecoin \(a stablecoin pegged to the Global Measurement Unit\). Users need to commit a minimum Collateralization Ratio\(CR\) of 110%. 

Because of the low collateralization ratio, it is essential to secure the protocol via other means. 

The protocol also uses secondary measures to secure the loans. In surplus to the 110% collateral committed, there exists a Stability Pool of ARTH valuecoin. This pool acts as a means of last resort if the protocol needs to go in Recovery mode.

### Use Cases: ARTH Loans 

1. **Borrowing made simple and minimal:** DeFi users can borrow a highly effective value stablecoin against their crypto assets with minimum Collateralization Ratio of 110% 
2. **Rewards with Stability Pool:** Users who pool their ARTH stablecoin in the Liquidity Pool to secure ARTH Loans earn rewards when loan positions are liquidated. Stability pool providers always remain in a net positive position. 
3. **Staking Pools that accumulate Fees:** Fees generated through the protocol in various ways are shared with stakers participating in various pools on [https://polygon.arthcoin.com/\#/farming](https://polygon.arthcoin.com/#/farming)
