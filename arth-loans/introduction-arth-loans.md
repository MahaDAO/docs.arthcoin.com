# Introduction: ARTH Loans

ARTH Loans is an algorithmic borrowing protocol that lets users draw [interest-free](https://app.gitbook.com/@liquity/s/liquity-docs/faq/borrowing#how-can-you-offer-borrowing-at-a-0-interest-rate) loans against their crypto assets used as collateral. Loans are always lent in ARTH valuecoin (a stablecoin pegged to the Global Measurement Unit). Users need to commit a minimum Collateralization Ratio(CR) of 110%.&#x20;

Because of the low collateralization ratio, it is essential to secure the protocol via other means.&#x20;

The protocol also uses secondary measures to secure the loans. In surplus to the 110% collateral committed, there exists a Stability Pool of ARTH valuecoin. This pool acts as a means of last resort if the protocol needs to go in Recovery mode. &#x20;
