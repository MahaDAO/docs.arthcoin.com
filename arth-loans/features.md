# Features

ARTH Loans will boast a number of features:

**0% Interest Loans\(at launch\):** You take out loans. That’s it. No interests accrued, at all. Loans are sanctioned when users put 110%+ collateral\(WMATIC, WETH, DAI\) into the system.

**Stability Pool for rewards\(at launch\):** As pooled users, you receive liquidated collateral as rewards. The pool always remains in a **net positive position** because of the model design. Stability pool providers provide the pool with their ARTH tokens.

**Minimal Collateralization Ratio\(at launch\):** 110% — that’s it. Although, we advise users to put a CR of not below 150%, the system allows for collateralization up to 110%. That means you can only be liquidated once your CR reaches below 110%.

**Leveraged Loans Position\(upcoming\):** Leveraged loans allow for DeFi users to not only create loan positions at 110% CR, but also take leverage on that position. We will introduce this feature soon.

**Staking Rewards\(already live\):** You can find a list of all staking/farming programs on [https://polygon.arthcoin.com/\#/farming](https://polygon.arthcoin.com/#/farming). More LP/Staking Pools with partner projects will be announced post-launch.
