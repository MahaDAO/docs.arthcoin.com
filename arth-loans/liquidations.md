# Liquidations

When a borrower's loan falls below the CR% of 110%, he/she is exposed to liquidation.

To ensure that ARTH is always fully backed by collateral, [l]()oan positions that fall under the minimum collateral ratio\(MCR\) of 110% will be liquidated or closed.

The debt of the Trove is canceled and absorbed by the Stability Pool and its collateral distributed among Stability Providers.

The borrower or the owner of the loan position still keeps the amount he received in ARTH as part of the borrowed loan borrowed but loses approximately 10% value overall.   
  
Thus, it is important to always keep the CR above 110% in normal mode and above 150% in [recovery mode]().
