# Launch Plan

ARTH Loans will be fully functional at launch except for redemptions & leveraged loans. While the latter requires further Stress Testing & Risk Weighted Average Testing, the former is to create a strategic advantage for the protocol.

Users will be able to create/add a loan position and borrow $ARTH and deposit their $ARTH to the Stability Pool or farm their ARTH tokens on [arthcoin.com](https://polygon.arthcoin.com/#/farming)

However, for 7â€“14 days after launch, loan redemptions will be disabled to encourage ecosystem growth and discourage excessive loan redemptions at launch. Redemptions will be enabled and notified through our various social channels.

Leveraged Loans will be made live once it clears all the stress tests.
