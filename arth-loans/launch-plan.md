# Launch Plan

ARTH Loans will be fully functional at launch except for loan redemptions & leveraged loans. While the latter requires further Stress Testing & Risk Weighted Average Testing, the former is to create a strategic advantage for the protocol. Closing a loan will be activated after 7 days. This is considered a bootstrapping phase for the protocol.  

Users will be able to create/add a loan position and borrow $ARTH. With the borrowed $ARTH, this can then be deposit to the Stability Pool, or alternatively farm their ARTH tokens on [arthcoin.com](https://arthcoin.com/).  
  
However, for 7 days after launch, loan redemptions will be disabled to encourage ecosystem growth and discourage excessive loan redemptions at launch. Redemptions will be enabled and notified through our various social channels after 7 days. 

Leveraged Loans will be made live once it clears all the stress tests.
