# Fiat-backed stablecoins

Fiat-backed stablecoins generally hold a 1:1 peg against their reserve collateral asset, in other words, any firm issuing a cryptocurrency equivalent of a fiat currency such as the US Dollar, is required to hold the commensurate amount of that fiat currency in reserve at all times, so as to meet claims made by purchasers of the stablecoin to redeem fiat currency in a timely manner.

The most widely used and popular fiat-backed stablecoin to date has been US Dollar Tether \(USDT\). Tether is operated by a private company called Tether Limited based in Hong Kong which also supports other stablecoins such as Chinese Yuan \(CNHT\), Euro \(EURT\) and a more recently announced stablecoin backed by 1 oz. of gold \(XAUT\).

Each USDT token is redeemable for a corresponding U.S. dollar held under custody by Tether Limited. The total value of all USDT is said to be equal to the reserves held by the firm, however those reserves have not been fully audited by any of the big 4 reputable accounting firms, so an element of trust in a centralized party is required.

**How is Tether created or minted:**

* New USDT enters the system when the Tether company mints it.
* When someone wants USDT, they make a payment to Tether. The company then adds those funds to its reserves and mints new USDT for the customer.
* USDT is removed from circulation in the same way. When someone wants to redeem USDT for USD, they can sell it back to the Tether company. Redeemed USDT is then destroyed and removed from circulation
* This process is typically only for bigger customers. The everyday Tether user will instead buy and sell USDT on a cryptocurrency exchange, the same as they would any other cryptocurrency.
