# FAQs - Stablecoins

## What is the purpose of an algorithmic stablecoin and why is it better than collateralized versions such as DAI?

The ultimate purpose is have stability as well as the capability to meet demand as well. Collateralized stablecoins like Dai are stable but don't have the ability to meet rising demand because depositing colateral often takes time.

## What strategies are in place to ensure a solid value proposition beyond the elastic supply mechanism in itself?

Currently elastic supply mechanisms influence the price by simply expanding & contracting the coin supply. However controlling the supply is a very weak way to influence the price.

With ARTH, we are integrating the protocol directly with Uniswap. Which means that traders participating in the algorithmic coin have a much more stronger impact on the price, than with other algorithmic coins.

## What are the weaknesses and strengths of the coupon vs rebase mechanism? Has the perfect mechanism been invented already?

The major weaknesses of most algorithmic coins mechanisms is that they print way too much coupons/bonds which in the end is debt that the protocol pays back. And coupons/bonds also have a very weak influence on the price.

We have addressed this problem by keeping a cap on how many bonds are issued and also changing the way that bonds are issued. Purchasing bonds in the ARTH protocol, happens by first buying-back ARTH with DAI from Uniswap and then issuing bonds against the bought-back ARTH. This allows us to allow purchasing of bonds to not only reduce the supply of ARTH but also have a much more stronger impact on the price.

The perfect mechanism is not yet out there which is why we are pushing the boundaries to innovate and find the perfect mechanism. We intend to contribute to other algorithmic stablecoins as well if our model proves successful.

## **Do algorithmic coins have a better chance of achieving value stability than Bitcoin, which after 10 years of the SoV narrative can still be extremely volatile?**

Algorithmic stablecoins are not stable because they don't have enough volume or market makers to support it, however they have shown their ability to scale to meet demand. On the other hand we have collateral based stablecoins that have shown that they can be stable but are harder to scale to meet demand.

The ideal solution is to take the best of both worlds and take a hybrid approach to it. Which is what many protocols \(including ARTH\) are looking to achieve.

## What is the starting price & target price of ARTH? \(Can it go down below US$ 1\)?

Although the starting price of ARTH is $1, it is never meant to be pegged to the dollar. The starting price of $1 was selected purely on the basis of ease of comparison of ARTH against the US Dollar over time.

ARTH's target price is pegged to the Global Measurement Unit or GMU which is a basket of assets \(80% Fiat, 15% Gold, 5% Bitcoin\).

Coming to the question of can the price of ARTH go below $1, we can simply answer that ARTH is created to maintain the buying power of people, meaning it can never fall in value. Whilst, US Dollar is a constantly depreciating currency\(in terms of value\) because of its economics, ARTH is a constantly stable currency\(in terms of value\) but a constantly appreciating currency\(against the US Dollar\).

## Can I use wallets other than Metamask?

The ARTH platform is currently only compatible Metamask. The team will be working to make the platform compatible with Coinbase, Ledger & other wallets in the future.

## What about legal and regulatory?

ARTH and ARTH Bonds are risky assets to play with on short term basis. You could lose all your money. Do not invest your money on this portal if you don’t know what you are doing.

## **How is ARTH & ARTHB different from other algo stable coins like ESD, DSD and others that are stuck in debt and bonds/coupons don’t work?**

ARTH is different than other algo stablecoins on various parameters.

The major difference being that ARTH Bonds are only minted when arth is bought back from Uniswap. While, in ESD/DSD coupons are minted when esd/dsd is burnt. Burning coins have a weak impact on the price. But buying back and burning coins has a stronger impact on the price.
