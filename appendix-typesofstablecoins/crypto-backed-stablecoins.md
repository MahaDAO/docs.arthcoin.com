# Crypto-backed stablecoins

Crypto-backed stablecoins operate in exactly the same way as fiat-backed stablecoins except their value is pegged to a cryptocurrency asset as opposed to a fiat currency. Cryptocurrency is locked up as collateral and stablecoins are issued/minted commensurate with the value of that cryptocurrency.

These however differ from fiat-backed stablecoins in that, due to the inherent volatility in the underlying cryptocurrency collateral, the stablecoin will not maintain a 1:1 ratio with collateral asset. For this reason, crypto-backed stablecoins are often over-collateralized, meaning the amount of collateral deposited is usually higher than the value of the stablecoin to be issued.

**DAI** - This concept of over-collateralization was developed by the MakerDAO team in the form of "Collateralized Debt Position \(CDP\) in order to create DAI - the most widely used crypto-backed stablecoin whose value is "softly" pegged to 1 US dollar. DAI is minted when a loan is taken out on MakerDAO by depositing ETH as collateral into the CDP platform smart contract. Locked collateral can be recovered at any time by paying back the borrowed DAI \(plus a stability fee\).

**MKR** - The price of DAI is kept in check through a system of smart contracts automatically executing themselves. If the price of DAI fluctuates too far from one dollar, Maker \(MKR\) tokens are burned or created in order to stabilize the price of DAI. MakerDAO’s algorithms automatically manage the price of DAI so no one person needs to be trusted to keep the currency steady. If the system works as intended and one DAI equals one US dollar, MKR holders benefit because the total supply of MKR decreases–making MKR more rare and valuable.

While DAI adoption has certainly grown and become a primary means of exchange for many DeFi protocols, it's inherent need for collateral makes it quite capital inefficient, meaning that if there is increased demand for DAI then the protocol suffers to keep up with this demand as there is a maximum ceiling of DAI that can be minted in order to meet that demand. 

This leads us to the next section where we discuss the unique concept of non-collateralized algorithmic stablecoins.
