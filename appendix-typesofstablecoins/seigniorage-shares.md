# Seigniorage Shares

Seigniorage comes from the old French term "right of the lord" \(seigneur\) to mint money. In traditional finance it is usually referred to as the value that governments enjoy due to the cost of minting coins being lower than their face value in exchange - a profit from money creation.

Seigniorage can be a convenient source of revenue for a government. By providing the government with increased purchasing power at the expense of public purchasing power, it imposes what is metaphorically known as an inflation tax on the public.

Stablecoins built on the seigniorage shares model consist of \(at least\) two tokens â€” the stablecoin and the investment token. The investment token here is similar to the role of the government, in that it is giving it's holders a benefit from incentivizing stablecoin creation by rewarding holders of the token.

Empty Set Dollar is the most recent project which has implemented a seigniorage model to grow the money supply. They have done so by distributing extra minted money supply to current holders of ESD when the market demands more ESD in order to meet the increased demand for ESD.

When the reverse happens, i.e. when demand goes down and the protocol has to reduce the supply of ESD, "coupons" are awarded to ESD holders to voluntarily burn their ESD. Coupons here are ESD's version of seigniorage shares.

When the money supply grows again the coupon holder may redeem their coupon for ESD at a one-to-one ratio. The risk associated is that if that coupon is not redeemed within a certain amount of time, \(90 epochs under current protocol\) that burned ESD is gone.

The coupon premium is based on the ratio of debt vs supply within the protocol. As the debt ratio increases the premium will increase along a curve. The current maximum for debt is 15% of the total supply and the maximum premium is 38.4%. This process happens regularly during fixed 8-hour time periods known as "Epochs", with coupons expiring after 90 epochs \(30 days\).
