# Asset-backed stablecoins

Asset-backed stablecoins, similarly to fiat-backed stablecoins, have their value pegged to the value of the asset backing it. The most simple example is a cryptocurrency which is 1:1 backed by the price of Gold.

One of the very first projects to introduce this concept of tokenizing physical gold assets onto the Ethereum blockchain via an ERC-20 token was the Digix Gold \(DGX\) project. The project is slightly different from that of Tether's XAUT in that 1 DGX is equal to 1 Gram of gold, as opposed to 1 ounce. 

Every gold bar backing DGX is always openly verifiable by the public, 24/7, with blockchain technology. The vaults holding Digix Gold are located in Singapore and Canada, are accredited members of the Bullion Association and are fully insured. So in essence there is also an element of centralization and trust involved here, which is hard to get around given the physical nature of the underlying asset.

The Digix Project is still in operation however in more recent times the most widely used gold-backed token has become the PAX Gold ERC-20 token \(PAXG\) which is issued by the Paxos Trust Company who also have a USD backed stablecoin PAX and specialize in providing whitelabel stablecoin issuance services to other companies such as Binance in the form of BUSD & other stablecoins.

Each token is backed by one fine troy ounce \(t oz\) of a 400 oz London Good Delivery gold bar, stored in Brinkâ€™s vaults. If you own PAXG, you own the underlying physical gold, held in custody by Paxos Trust Company.
