# Providing Liquidity on SushiSwap

Once you hold ARTH and DAI in your metamask, you can stake liquidity via Uniswap.

On MahaSwap, you need to provide both sides of the liquidity in order to generate the LP tokens. In this case, simply enter the amount of ARTH you wish to add, and MahaSwap will automatically fill out the DAI side. Click **Supply** to confirm the transaction:
