# How to Mint ARTH

### **Understanding the Basics**:

* **ARTH**: It is a type of flatcoin that maintains its value through collateral backing, primarily ETH in this case.
* **Peg**: The target price that ARTH aims to maintain.

### **Prepare Your Collateral**:

* Ensure you have sufficient ETH or other accepted collateral in your wallet to start the minting process.

### **Connect Your Wallet**:

* Connect your digital wallet (where you store your ETH or other cryptocurrencies) to the ARTH protocol on the Base Network.

### **Access the ARTH DApp**:

* Navigate to the ARTH decentralized application (DApp) on the Base Network.

### **Deposit Collateral**:

* Choose the amount of ETH you want to deposit as collateral to mint ARTH. This deposit backs the ARTH you will mint, ensuring its stability.

1. **Mint ARTH**:
   * Enter the amount of ARTH you wish to mint. It should be equivalent to the value of the deposited ETH.
2. **Confirm the Transaction**:
   * Review the details of the transaction and confirm it in your wallet to initiate the minting process.
3. **Completion**:
   * Upon successful transaction verification, ARTH will be minted and added to your wallet.
4. **Understanding Arbitrage Opportunities (Advanced)**:
   * For those looking to engage in arbitrage:
     * Mint ARTH when it is trading above its peg (target price).
     * Sell the minted ARTH in the open market for a profit, betting that the price will revert back to its peg.
     * This is typically done through a loan process where ARTH is minted using collateral.
