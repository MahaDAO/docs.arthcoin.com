# Earning Inflationary Rewards\(Seigniorage\)

If you have performed either of the previous 2 steps, you now hold either:   
- ARTH   
- ARTH-DAI LP tokens having provided liquidity to the MahaSwap pair 

To continue, go back to the [ARTH webpage ](http://arthcoin.com/)and move to the [Distribution](https://arthcoin.com/#/distribution) tab, where you can **bond/stake** these tokens to earn inflationary rewards.

There are 3 options for you to earn inflationary rewards: 

* **Bond ARTH-DAI MahaSwap LP tokens \(70%\)**
* **Bond ARTH tokens \(20%\)**
* **Bond MAHA tokens \(10%\)**

You can choose either or all 3, but to go ahead and stake tokens on the platform. You must first approve the tokens**.**  
  
Please Note: Inflationary Rewards can only be earned when the ARTH protocol is in an expansion phase. To check the inflationary rewards structure, please move over to the [**Seigniorage Share**](../arth-201/expansion-mechanics/seiongrage-distribution.md) ****page.
