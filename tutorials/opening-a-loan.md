# Opening a Loan

The loan system mainly works on you exchanging WMATIC, WETH or DAI for ARTH at 0% interest. Two modes that play a crucial role in getting a loan.

* **Normal mode:** In the normal mode the collateral ratio must be at least 110%
* **Recovery mode:** In recovery mode, the collateral ratio must be at least 150% when opening a loan.

**Step 1:** For a user who wants to take a loan; click on the 'open loan' button. If a user has opened any loans before and wants to check the status can check it below in the opened loans list.

**Step 3:** After you select the asset; you need to input an amount that is going to be the collateral amount from your end. NOTE: In normal mode, the amount you enter has to be amounting to a collateral ratio of at least 110% or more. It is advised to keep it well above 150% so that you can avoid liquidation under recovery mode.

**Step 4:** Once you have entered the amount you will see the minimum ARTH that you will receive. It also tells you the total debt amount which is inclusive of the borrowing fee and liquidation reserve.\


**Step 5:** After step 4 you need to click on the confirm loan button to open your loan.
