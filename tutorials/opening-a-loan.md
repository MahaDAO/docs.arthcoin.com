# Opening a Loan

The loan system mainly works on you exchanging `MATIC`, `WETH` or `BNB` for `ARTH` at 0% interest. Two modes play a crucial role in getting a loan.

* **Normal mode:** In the normal mode the collateral ratio must be at least 110%
* **Recovery mode:** In recovery mode, the collateral ratio must be at least 150% when opening a loan.
