# Opening a Loan

The loan system mainly works on you exchanging `MATIC`, `WETH` or `BNB` for `ARTH` at 0% interest. Two modes play a crucial role in getting a loan.

* **Normal mode:** In the normal mode the collateral ratio must be at least 110%
* **Recovery mode:** In recovery mode, the collateral ratio must be at least 150% when opening a loan.

**Step 1:** For a user who wants to take a loan; click on the **Open a Loan** button. If a user has opened any loans before and wants to check the status can check it below in the opened loans list.

**Step 3:** After you select the asset; you need to input an amount that is going to be the collateral amount from your end.&#x20;

_**NOTE:** In normal mode, the amount you enter has to be amounting to a collateral ratio of at least 110% or more. It is advised to keep it well above 150% so that you can avoid liquidation under recovery mode._

**Step 4:** Once you have entered the amount you will see the minimum `ARTH` that you will receive. It also tells you the total debt amount which is inclusive of the borrowing fee and liquidation reserve.

**Step 5:** Click on the **confirm loan** button to open your loan.
