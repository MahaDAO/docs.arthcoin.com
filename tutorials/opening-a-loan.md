# Opening a Loan

The loan system mainly works on you exchanging WMATIC, WETH or DAI for ARTH at 0% interest. Two modes that play a crucial role in getting a loan.

* **Normal mode:** In the normal mode the collateral ratio must be at least 110%\\
* **Recovery mode:** In recovery mode, the collateral ratio must be at least 150% when opening a loan.

**Step 1:** For a user who wants to take a loan; click on the 'open loan' button. If a user has opened any loans before and wants to check the status can check it below in the opened loans list.

**Step 3:** After you have selected the currency; you need to input an amount that is going to be the collateral amount from your end. NOTE: In normal mode the amount you enter has to be amounting to a collateral ratio of at least 110% or more. It is advised to keep it well above 150% so that you can avoid liquidation under recovery mode.
