# Welcome to MahaSwap

## **What is MahaSwap?**

MahaSwap is a replica of Uniswap & its migration contracts are a fork of Sushiswap so they offer a safe, audit-proofed and trusted environment.

The **MahaSwap platform** enables $ARTH to move in the direction it should, thereby maintaining its price peg but also rewarding users who take positive actions by rewarding $MAHA & $ARTH through various ways, such as Staking your LP tokens to earn $MAHA, bonding your LP tokens to earn $ARTH Seigniorage\(scheduled for later during the expansion phase\), and more.

üöÄ**MahaSwap launched on Feb 9th, 3pm GMT.**
