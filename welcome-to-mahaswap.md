# Welcome to MahaSwap

## **What is MahaSwap?** 

MahaSwap is a replica of Uniswap & its migration contracts are a fork of Sushiswap so they offer a safe, audit-proofed and trusted environment.

The **MahaSwap platform** enables $ARTH to move in the direction it should, thereby maintaining its price peg but also rewarding users who take positive actions by rewarding $MAHA & $ARTH through various ways, such as Staking your LP tokens to earn $MAHA, bonding your LP tokens to earn $ARTH Seigniorage\(scheduled for later during the expansion phase\), and more.

üöÄ**MahaSwap launched on Feb 9th, 3pm GMT.** 

### ‚ÑπÔ∏èImportant Timelines 

* Launch of MahaSwap: **Tuesday, February 9, 3pm GMT**
* Migration of LP tokens to MahaSwap will start from **Tuesday, February 9, 3pm GMT**
* Staking MahaSwap LP tokens to earn $MAHA starts from **Tuesday, February 9, 4pm GMT**
* Trading starts from **Wednesday, February 10, 3 pm GMT**

To avoid any chance of an impermanent loss, there is a 24 hr gap between when migration starts & when trading starts. \(Trading will be paused during migration\).
